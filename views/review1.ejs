        <h2>Story</h2>
        <h3>Settings</h3>
        <blockquote>Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat, and is composed of seven major nations being Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya. In addition to these nations there is Celestia, a mysterious floating island which is allegedly home to gods and mortals who have ascended to godhood through great, heroic feats. The player character, Traveler, is separated from their twin and becomes trapped on Teyvat. They are joined by a companion, Paimon, as they journey through Teyvat in search for their lost sibling.
          Each nation is associated with and worships one of The Seven, a group of gods known as Archons who each preside over one of the seven nations. Each member of The Seven is tied to one of the game's elements, and is also reflected in their nation's aspect. Barbatos, Rex Lapis, Raiden Shogun, and Tsaritsa are archons of Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma and Snezhnaya, respectively. However, the god who is the Archon may change over time as Archons pass away. Specific individuals chosen by the Archons are granted a Vision â€” magical gemstones that give their bearers the ability to command an element and the potential to ascend to godhood and reside Celestia. 
          Mondstadt, the city of freedom, worships the Anemo Archon Barbatos and sits on an island in the middle of a lake. The city is protected by The Knights of Favonius, who are tasked with protecting Mondstadt and its citizens. To the southwest, Liyue worships the Geo Archon Rex Lapis and is the largest market harbor in Teyvat. The harbor city is presided over by the Liyue Qixing: a group of buisiness leaders, and ancient guardians known as Adepti, magical beings that includes Rex Lapis himself.
          Snezhnaya, ruled by the Cryo Archon Tsaritsa, send out diplomats named the Fatui who maintain a friendly appearance while using more underhanded methods secretly. The Fatui are also Led by the Eleven Harbingers, individuals given extraordinary powers and god-like executive authority by the Tsarista. Among them include Scaramouche, Signora, and Childe, who are respectively the sixth, eighth, and eleventh of the Eleven Harbingers. In addition to the Fatui, another antagonistic faction in the game is the Abyss Order, a mysterious, but powerful legion of monsters that declares themselves to be enemies to all of humanity, and are led by the "Prince" or "Princess," their gender being opposite of Traveler's.

        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <blockquote>A pair of twins who travel across the stars and visit different worlds arrive in Teyvat but are separated by an unknown god, who takes one and seals away the other. Some undisclosed amount of time later the sealed twin, referred to as the "Traveler", awakens and meets Paimon. The pair travel to nearby Mondstadt to start their search for their missing twin.
          Paimon and Traveler arrive at Mondstadt, and encounter a dragon named Stormterror which attacks the city. Aided by an unknown entity later revealed to be Venti, Traveler fends off Stormterror and is recognized by Jean, acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. Traveler helps the Knights restore order to the region, and then meets Venti, who comes up with a plan to stop Stormterror. Venti requests for them to retrieve a holy lyre so that he may play it to Stormterror, calming him. After retrieving the lyre, which was first stolen by Fatui, Venti attempts to calm Stormterror but realizes that the Abyss Order have been manipulating him the whole time, and Venti's true identity is revealed: Barbatos, the Anemo Archon. Traveler, accompanied by Jean and Venti, pursue Stormterror to his domain and free him from the Abyss Order's influence. Returning to Mondstadt Venti is ambushed by the Fatui Harbinger La Signora, who steals his Gnosis.  
          The Traveler resolves to meet the other six Archons to find their sibling's whereabouts and the unknown god. Venti advises the Traveler to travel to Liyue next to meet Rex Lapis during a ritual. However during the ritual Rex Lapis is apparently killed. Investigating the death, Traveler is manipulated by Fatui Harbinger Childe to work with Zhongli, a funeral parlor consultant who is overseeing Rex Lapis' funeral. While working with Zhongli, Childe finds out the location of Rex Lapis'.        </blockquote>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <blockquote>Genshin Impact is an open world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly and during combat to the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks. Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips. In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are highly powerful challenges that reward highly valuable resources, but claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time. Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level. The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives. 
          The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding which are limited by stamina. Some characters possess abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water to create a path that can aid the player in traversing terrain. Many teleportation nodes exist throughout the world that players can warp to, and statues known as the Statues of the Seven can heal and revive characters and provide benefits such as increasing player stamina. Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world, while enemies and treasure chests drop other types of resources that may be used in enhancing a character's strength. Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering wild fruit and vegetables, or purchasing them from a store. Most ingredients can be cooked into a dish. Some meals regenerate characters' health, while others boost various statistics. Mining can be done by attacking and destroying mining nodes to produce ore. Ore can be refined and then used to enhance weapon strength or create weapons. 
          Each character has two unique combat skills: an elemental skill and an elemental burst. The elemental skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use. In contrast, the elemental burst has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy by defeating enemies or inflicting elemental statuses. Characters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro and Geo, which correspond to ice, nature, fire, water, air, electricity, and earth respectively. These elements can interact in different ways; for example, if a Hydro attack hits a target, the enemy will be inflicted with the "Wet" status, and if they are hit with a Cryo attack, it will inflict "Cold". These two statuses combine into the "Frozen" status, temporarily preventing the target from performing any actions or until the player deals enough physical damage to the enemy. Switching between characters during combat and executing those skills allows those elemental interactions to take place. Certain elemental abilities may be required to solve puzzles within the overworld. 
          A multiplayer mode is available in the form of co-op. Up to 4 players can play together in the overworld and join domains. Player matching can either be done by requesting to connect with another player. If the player wishes to clear a domain with other players, they will be automatically matched up with others looking to tackle the same objective. The game features cross-platform play, so players on any platform can play with each other. 
          By completing quests to advance the story, the player can unlock three additional playable characters, and more characters can be obtained via a gacha mechanic. Several premium in-game currencies, obtainable through in-app purchases and playing the game, can be used to obtain characters and weapons through the gacha system.
